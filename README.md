I am thinking on having a Tiddler Commander to do the below jobs in one place.

These are kind of batch (bulk) operation and work on a group of tiddlers or a bunch of tiddlers.
A bunch of tiddlers is a group of tiddlers meet some criteria like having a common tag, common filed, have a common word in their title, created the same day, or month or year and like that.

# The bulk operation

* Rename tiddlers
* use  a totally new name
* add a suffix/prefix to title
* add prefix to title
* replace part of title
* add ordinal number to title 
* Copy tiddlers (make duplicates)
* Add/remove tag or any field
* Change/replace the content of any field
* Create empty bulk tiddlers (for lecture or slideshow) having common properties (tag, field, part of text,...)
* Capability to undo the operation at least one step
* Capability to get the user confirmation before doing the operation
