## Batch operation
Making the same changes to large numbers of tiddlers in TW5 can be repetetive and time consuming.

* Batch operations work on groups of tiddlers at the same time and make changes 'in bulk', in one go.

* Batch operations operate on groups of tiddlers that share matching criteria.

* Tiddlers which share  a common tag, a common field, a word in their title, or were  created on the same day, month or year are all candidates for batch operations.

As a result batch operations can save users a great deal of time but, because they work on several tiddlers at once, the price of a mistake is multiplied! Back-up your wiki!

### Types of Batch operations :
* create/delete bulk of tidlers
* Rename tiddlers
* add a suffix/prefix to title
* add ordinal number to title 
* Add/remove tag or any field
* Change/replace the content of any field
* Inspect tiddlers
